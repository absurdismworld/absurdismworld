<p>So you don't like your song being on this channel? That's alright. You have your reasons, I don't ask for them or honestly really care.<br>
<br>
I will honor your takedown request no questions asked, isn't that nice? In all cases except:<br>
You don't comment from your main account or email using a recognizable email. In that case I will just need you to verify your identity, after that consider it done.<br>
<br>
Comment requests take up to 72 hours, email requests up to 90 days. They will probably take less but can take more, but I try my hardest to honor them within the allocated time period.<br>
<br>
How do takedowns work? After requesting one, the video will be privated for 30-90 days. During this time it can be reversed. After this time period there is no reversing and is considered<br>
permanently blocked. Note: a takedown request for one track applies for all done by the artist, unless explicitly stated.<br>
<br>
FAQ:<br>
Q: You haven't removed my track within the 72 hour/90 day time period, why?<br>
A: This most likely won't happen but if it does I'm sorry, it will be removed as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
Q: I requested one of my tracks to be takendown, do I need to request all of them?<br>
A: Nope! Unless otherwise stated, one request will takedown all uploaded tracks and will block further uploads.<br>
<br>
Q: I didn't request my track to be removed. What's going on?<br>
A: Seems like you've been hacked or impersonated, contact me and we'll sort this out.<br>
<br>
Q: A track of mine that I requested to be blocked is back on your channel, what gives?<br>
A: This most likely will not happen. But human errors do happen, if this does happen notify me and it will be taken down accordingly.<br>
<br>
Q: Are takedown requests private?<br>
A: Takedown requests are always pseudonymised (do not reveal personal information) but will be disclosed if inquired about. Any personal information, e.g your email, real name, will not be revealed no matter what.<br>
<br>
Q: Why is the video only privated, why not deleted?<br>
A: To prevent uploading already blocked tracks.<br>
<br>
Q: After takedown, if my tracks get deleted or purged will you unblock the uploads here?<br>
A: Nope, you don't have to worry about that. Once blocked the tracks stay blocked.<br>
