<p><i>Heya anon, welcome to my own little corner of the internet.</i><br></p>
<br>
<sa>About me:</sa><br>
<p>I ain't writting no autobiography here so I'll keep it short.<br>
I'm absurdismworld, but most just call me absurd.<br>
<br>
I'm just your average internet denizen, tinkering around with projects I don't really understand and trying to do my part in saving internet media that I care about.<br>
Non-profit/for fun is the name of my game, there's enough internet money making sleezebags and I don't want to be one of them.<br>
<br>
<u>My interests are in no way unique but include:</u> indie vidya, old school anime (and the occasional new one that ain't complete shit), experimental music, <del>obscure anime internet god</del>, old/obscure internet culture and media... There's probably some other stuff.<br>
<br>
<sa>FAQ:</sa><br>
<p><u>Enough about me, what about this website?</u><br>
Well this website is a collection of my internet projects. That's pretty much it really. It might include <del>my ramblings</del> blog posts at a later date.<br></p>
<p><u>Why do some pages look vastly better then others?</u><br>
A lot of what you see on the site I made myself, with priority of it just werking. Like this one. The pretty parts are made by people that know what they're doing and I thank them for it.</p>
<p><u>Why did you make X?</u><br>
